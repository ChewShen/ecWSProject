- **Monaco Editor alongside with React (Vite)**
  -----------
1. The code and pages able to run using the piston API so far, but the run time is concerning due to api not local hosting
2. ui/ux can still be improve

**Further Improvement**
  -----------
1. Diamgram Should be Fully Render automatically without Chatbot, For instance, When user stop typing on the Code Editor Page, gemini scan through the code and automatically generate diagram (can be choose by user as flowchart, sequence and so on) without copy paste the
   Code into chatbot.
2. Cloud Server (AWS in this case is not implemented due to trials has expired.)
3. Collaboration
